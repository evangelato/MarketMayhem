# Market Mayhem

The gameplay is limited to a scenario and the game is meant to be demo. At the start of the game, the player does not have a gun and is able to pick up a coin on the Slerp vending machine. The player can use that coin to buy a gun from the Shark salesman and the gun can be shot at a breakable box object.

Playable on itch.io: https://evangelato.itch.io/market-mayhem
